### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Utkarsh Ujwal, an aspiring AI Researcher with a keen interest in Data Mining, Modern (with a tinge of classical ) NLP and LLMs. 
My research interests are as follows:
- Guardrails & Redteaming for LLMs
- Tool use & execution with LLM powered Agents.
- Interpretability in text classification.
- Hallucination mitigation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Transformer ablation + memory/runtime optimization
- End-to-End GenAI application development.

Publications:
I have published a paper on improving legal reasoning within LLMs (accepted in ACM-CIKM Conference 2024).
One of my papers (on one of the tasks within Erisk 2024) was also accepted as a spotlight presentation in IJCAI 2025 Workshop.

Prior Work Experience:
Worked as an Applied AI Scientist with Inspeq AI (Jul 2024- Jun 2025).
Worked as a Data Scientist with University of Liverpool (May 2024 -Jul 2024).

Feel free to connect with me via email at utkarsh.ujwal8005@gmail.com. 
I'm enthusiastic about exploring the intersection of data mining and building interpretable and optimised LLM systems.
